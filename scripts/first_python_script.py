# List 
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Tuple - can't have values replaced
y = ("one", "two", "three")

# Dictionary - contains keys
z = {"h": 1, "i": 2, "j": 3}

# Lists can have their values substituted
x[0] = 42

# Just as dictionaries
z["h"] = 78

# We can reverse the list with
x[::-1]

# As well as the Tuple
y[::-1]

# But we can't do it with dictionaries - their index is only done with the keys
